# Mini-Projects
**A collection of small, occasionally unfinished side-projects**

Projects fall broadly into one of these buckets:
- **Data analysis**: primarily building models, creating data visualizations and collecting, validating and storing data
- **Simple apps:**: Small apps written mostly in app scripts or javascript including a lot of Google Spreadsheet Apps
- **Product Design**: wireframes and prototypes relating to more ambitious products
- **Hardware/IoT**: Raspberry Pi, Arduino and a whole lot of sensors


### Simple Apps
#### SettleUp
This is an app script-driven google spreadsheet for splitting home finances between two people. It's complete for the time being but I may add a version for more than two users later
